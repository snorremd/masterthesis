abstract = {Because meaningful sentences are composed of meaningful words, any system that hopes to process natural languages as people do must have information about words and their meanings. This information is traditionally provided through dictionaries, and machine-readable dictionaries are now widely available. But dictionary entries evolved for the convenience of human readers, not for machines. WordNet1 provides a more effective combination of traditional lexicographic information and modern computing. WordNet is an online lexical database designed for use under program control. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into sets of synonyms, each representing a lexicalized concept. Semantic relations link the synonym sets 4.},

abstract = {The DBpedia project is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information accessible on the Web. The resulting DBpedia knowledge base currently describes over 2.6 million entities. For each of these entities, DBpedia defines a globally unique identifier that can be dereferenced over the Web into a rich RDF description of the entity, including human-readable definitions in 30 languages, relationships to other resources, classifications in four concept hierarchies, various facts as well as data-level links to other Web data sources describing the entity. Over the last year, an increasing number of data publishers have begun to set data-level links to DBpedia resources, making DBpedia a central interlinking hub for the emerging Web of Data. Currently, the Web of interlinked data sources around DBpedia provides approximately 4.7 billion pieces of information and covers domains such as geographic information, people, companies, films, music, genes, drugs, books, and scientific publications. This article describes the extraction of the DBpedia knowledge base, the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other data sources on the Web, and gives an overview of applications that facilitate the Web of Data around DBpedia.},

In addition, we explain why distributional similarity is not an adequate proxy for lexical semantic relatedness.},

We take an engineering perspective on the development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices are evaluated against the design criteria. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited},

abstract = {Design work and design knowledge in Information Systems ( IS) is important for both research and practice. Yet there has been comparatively little critical attention paid to the problem of specifying design theory so that it can be communicated, justified, and developed cumulatively. In this essay we focus on the structural components or anatomy of design theories in IS as a special class of theory. In doing so, we aim to extend the work of Walls, Widemeyer and El Sawy ( 1992) on the specification of information systems design theories (ISDT), drawing on other streams of thought on design research and theory to provide a basis for a more systematic and useable formulation of these theories. We identify eight separate components of design theories: ( 1) purpose and scope, ( 2) constructs, ( 3) principles of form and function, ( 4) artifact mutability, ( 5) testable propositions, ( 6) justificatory knowledge ( kernel theories), ( 7) principles of implementation, and ( 8) an expository instantiation. This specification includes components missing in the Walls et al. adaptation of Dubin ( 1978) and Simon ( 1969) and also addresses explicitly problems associated with the role of instantiations and the specification of design theories for methodologies and interventions as well as for products and applications. The essay is significant as the unambiguous establishment of design knowledge as theory gives a sounder base for arguments for the rigor and legitimacy of IS as an applied discipline and for its continuing progress. A craft can proceed with the copying of one example of a design artifact by one artisan after another. A discipline cannot.},

@article{Miller1990a,
abstract = {Definitions of common nouns typically give a superordinate term plus distinguishing features; that information provides the basis for organizing noun files in WordNet. The superordinate relation (hyponymy) generates a hierarchical semantic organization that is duplicated in the noun files by the use of labeled pointers between sets of synonyms (synsets). The hierarchy is limited in depth, seldom exceeding more than a dozen levels. Distinguishing features are entered in such a way as to create a lexical inheritance system, a system in which each word inherits the distinguishing features of all its superordinates. Three types of distinguishing features are discussed: attributes (modification), parts (meronymy) and functions (predication), but only meronymy is presently implemented in the noun files. Antonymy is also found between nouns, but it is not a fundamental organizing principle for nouns. Coverage is partitioned into twenty-five topical files, each of which deals with a different primitive semantic component. Characteristics of each topic are discussed.},

@article{Damme2007,
abstract = {We can observe that the amount of non-toy domain ontologies is still very limited for many areas of interest. In contrast, folksonomies are widely in use for (1) tagging Web pages (e.g. del.icio.us), (2) annotating pictures (e.g. flickr), or (3) classifying scholarly publications (e.g. bibsonomy). However, such folksonomies cannot offer the expressivity of ontologies, and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning. Also, folksonomies and other unsupervised vocabularies frequently suffer from inconsistencies and redundancies. In this paper, we argue that the social interaction manifested in folksonomies and in their usage should be exploited for building and maintaining ontologies. Then, we sketch a comprehensive approach for deriving ontologies from folksonomies by integrating multiple resources and techniques. In detail, we suggest combining (1) the statistical analysis of folksonomies, associated usage data, and their implicit social networks, (2) online lexical resources like dictionaries, Wordnet, Google and Wikipedia, (3) ontologies and Semantic Web resources, (4) ontology mapping and matching approaches, and (5) functionality that helps human actors in achieving and maintaining consensus over ontology element suggestions resulting from the preceding steps.},

@article{Veres2004,
abstract = {Abstract. WordNet is an electronic lexical database structured around psychological and linguistic principles. As such, it should play a part in any effort to integrate cognitive factors into knowledge based systems. Yet, some of its basic assumptions have been attacked, and the sug- gestion made that a major restructuring would make it more cognitively transparent. We investigate these allegations from a psycholinguistic perspective and conclude that WordNet is in fact rigorous in terms of the cognitive principles it embodies. What is lacking is a methodology for translating the explicit and implicit knowledge in WordNet into a usable, formal ontologies. We show some ways in which WordNet should be ex- tended to facilitate this process. We agree that WordNet is not in itself ready for use as a formal ontology, but we argue that it is an invaluable tool for describing the conceptualized structure of our world, and should be used as a fundamental resource.},
